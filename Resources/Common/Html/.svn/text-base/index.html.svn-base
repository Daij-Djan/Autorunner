	<h3>About:</h3>
	<p>
		Autorunner will reside in your menubar and provide windows-like 'autoplay' functionality.<br/>
		<img src="ARMenubar.png">
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever a volume is mounted (disk image, cd, external drive, sd card, network share, ...) it executes a selected command on it:
	</p>
	<p>
		The first time a volume is mounted, a chooser window is shown where the commang to be executed can be selected.<br/>
		<table width="100%">
		<tr>
		<td width="50%">
			<img width="250" src="ARChooser1.png">
		</td>
		<td width="50%">
			<img width="250" src="ARChooser2.png">
		</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
	</p>
	<p>
		Every time the same volume is mounted from now, Autorunner looks if an command has been previously selected and saved. If that is the case, it executes the found command.<br/>

	</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3>
	<p>
		Autorunner ignores Audio-CDs and Video-DVDs as default commands for these media are configured via the system preferences.<br/>
		<br/>
		When presenting the chooser window for a given volume, Autorunner looks for certain files/commands to be added to the selection directly.
		The 'Show Contents', 'Browse for file' and 'ignore' option is always shown but in addition the app looks for likely Installers and Readme text/html files.<br/>
		LAST BUT NOT LEAST<br/>
		The application searches for a file named Autorun, which can be anything you want - Most often it will be an alias to an app. <b>But even in that case, the file is NOT immediately executed!</b>
